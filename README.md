# Car Purchase Prediction with Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
This repository contains Python code for predicting car purchase amounts using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The ANN model is trained on the Car Purchasing Data, utilizing TensorFlow and Scikit-learn for data processing and model building.

## **File Description**
### **ann.py**
This Python script focuses on:
- Loading and preprocessing Car Purchasing Data using Pandas.
- Data splitting into training and test sets.
- Constructing an Artificial Neural Network using TensorFlow's Keras API.
- Compiling and training the ANN model with specified hyperparameters.
- Evaluating the trained model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and accuracy metrics.
- Predicting car purchase amounts for test data and a single value.
- Assessing the model's performance using R-squared score.

## **Dataset**
The dataset used for this project is 'Car_Purchasing_Data.csv', containing various customer features such as age, salary, credit card debt, etc., and their corresponding car purchase amounts.

## **Usage**
1. Clone the repository to your local environment:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Car-Purchase-Prediction.git
   ```
